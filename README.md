# Lab Session #2 for Deep Learning @ KAIST

This repository covers three topics with their implementations as follows:

* Regularization Techniques for Deep Learning

    * Dropout
    * L2 Normalization
    * Batch Normalization

* Convolutional Neural Network
* Recurrent Neural Network

The material is modified from the implementation of [this repository](https://github.com/MorvanZhou/PyTorch-Tutorial).
